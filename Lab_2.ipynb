A good example is you can see that a bunch of teams share the common mascot of a human due to the size of the bubble, and they also make the tournament more often. The darkness and size of the bubble directly represents the amount of points scored for the bubble. The unlabeled bubble is for common names that are not large enough data points to be represented in tableau. We can conclude from this lots of teams have human and wildcat mascots, therefore they all in total score more points."

Overall there was not too much of a difference thought the week in terms of average winning points. The biggest difference was on Wednesday where they average was lower, this could be due to teams being tired in the middle of the week or they really just don’t like Wednesdays. The coloring helps illuminate this difference by making Wednesday the lightest color in the blue color scheme."

This trend actually demonstrates the constant struggle of basketball, following trends of tough defense and hot offense."

The data itself in this graph shows that the average winning seed in March Madness usually can be around the 5th seed. However, we do have one outlier year that shows the data can be influenced by high ranking teams all doing extremely well. This shows us the most consistent teams you can pick to win are usually higher seeded."
